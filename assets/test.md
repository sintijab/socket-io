#### 1. **Rhythmic Scale and Patterns**
   Rhythmic features capture the pulse, timing, and structure of a piece. They help define how sound flows, interacts, and drives forward motion.

- **Rhythmic Scale**:
  - Micro (subtle subdivisions of a beat, polyrhythms)
  - Macro (overall rhythmic pattern, overarching structure)
  - Recursive (repeating motifs, self-similar patterns)
  - Fluid (shifting, ambiguous timing signatures)

- **Tempo Modulation**:
  - Accelerando (gradually speeding up)
  - Ritardando (gradually slowing down)
  - Rubato (expressive tempo flexibility)
  - Static (constant, unchanging beat)

- **Beat Types**:
  - **Even Beats**: Straight, four-on-the-floor, standard 4/4 or 3/4 time
  - **Syncopation**: Off-beat accents, irregular timing
  - **Complex Rhythms**: Polyrhythms, tuplets, hemiolas
  - **Dissonant Beats**: Cross-rhythms, staggered downbeats

#### 2. **Tempo and Speed Qualities**
   Tempo is more than just beats per minute—it can convey energy, urgency, or calm.

- **Tempo Range**:
  - **Slow**: <60 BPM (Largo, Adagio, Grave)
  - **Medium**: 60–120 BPM (Andante, Moderato, Allegro)
  - **Fast**: >120 BPM (Vivace, Presto, Prestissimo)

- **Tempo Complexity**:
  - Constant / Modulating / Gradual Changes
  - Metric Modulation (shifting subdivisions)
  - Polytemporal (multiple tempos interacting)

#### 3. **Sound Technique and Production Style**
   Production techniques define the unique sonic signature of a track, from synthesis to mixing.

- **Instrument Type**:
  - Synthesizers: Analog, Digital, Modular, Semi-Modular
  - Drum Machines: TR-808, TR-909, LinnDrum, MPC
  - Acoustic: String (Violin, Guitar), Percussion (Djembe, Taiko)
  - Experimental: Found Objects, Circuit Bending, Contact Mics

- **Sound Effects and Processing**:
  - Reverb: Cathedral, Plate, Gated, Hall
  - Delay: Tape, Ping-Pong, Slapback, Feedback Loop
  - Distortion: Overdrive, Bit-Crushing, Fuzz, Saturation
  - Spatial Effects: Doppler Shifts, Auto-Panning, Haas Effect
